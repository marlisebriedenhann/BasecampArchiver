# BasecampArchiver

We are decommissioning Basecamp (https://basecamp.com/).

As part of this decommissioning we need to archive Basecamp data is case we need to access it in the future.

The IT team will be downloading project archives which will contain an index.html.

We need to write a script that will run through a folder of these project archives parsing the index.html and output a .csv file with a row each with: - The project ID
- The project name
- The project URL
